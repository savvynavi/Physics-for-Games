# Physics-for-Games

Main Menu:
	From here you can hit up or down to access any of the 3 demos available, to enter into one just hit space while
	the > is next to it. While inside any demo hitting ESC will exit back to the menu at any time.

Pinball:
	This application allows you to play a game of pinball (minus the score), where you have 3 lives until game over.
	Use the left and right arrows to move the paddles to hit the ball, which can be pushed out of the starting area
	by click/dragging on the ball and then in the opposite direction you want it to go. When you're out of lives you 
	can hit R to restart the game.
	
Physics Demo:
	This creates a small scene with a rope bridge, a soft body and several planes all being affected by gravity.
	Holding down the right mouse button will spawn spheres at the mouse point, which will interact with the things
	in the scene. Hit R at any time to reset the scene.
